# Android XML Animations
Android Animation with XML file

Like all XML file, there must be a single root element.
The elements performing animations are:
 
<alpha>
<scale>
<translate>
<rotate>

Animations elements may be grouped using the <set> element. 
In addition to other properties, each animation's starting time and duration are specified allowing for either sequential or simultaneous animation.
